# EEG_Project

This repository contains three different Deep Learning models based on CNNs. The purpose is to analyze EEG signals and determine whether they belong to alcoholic or control subjects. Each model features its own architecture and operates in a distinct manner. The first model is a conventional CNN, the second model transforms signals into STFT images for analysis, and the final model is a CNN specialized for EEG signals known as “EEGNet.”
